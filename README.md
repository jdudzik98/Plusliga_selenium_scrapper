## General info
In this repository you can find the complete code to run a Selenium scrapper, downloading point-by-point match data from Plusliga volleyball matches from seasons 2020/21 up until 2022/2023. Moreover, there is a complete scrapped dataset for the mentioned years,
stored within repository. In the future I am planning to modernize the project by adding current year and write function to fetch data during the game.

## Purpose and technology choice
The project was a data layer of my master thesis about predicting the outcome of volleyball match throughout the game. As there were no public resources available, I have decided to scrape the data myself.
I have chosen Python as the language I was familiar with in terms of scraping and as both bs4 and scrapy libraries failed due to dynamic components on the pages, I have decided to use Selenium 

## Technologies
* Python 3
* Selenium
